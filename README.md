# DAPI
A Bukkit Plugin API to make it easier to code Plugins.
From Beginner for Beginners.
Because I'm coming from Germany the Javadoc when it exist is in German because my English is not the best and good.

I plan some new Changes to the new Version this is the 0.2 because i add a lot of new Features.
No new Files will be added i add them then they are ready.
